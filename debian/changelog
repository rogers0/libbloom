libbloom (1.4-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/copyright:
    - Move the paragraph of MIT/Expat license to the right position.
      Text copy of MIT/Expat license is from debmake package:
        /usr/share/debmake/extra4/Expat
  * debian/control:
    - Add collab-maint Vcs repo.
  * debian/rules:
    - Fix Multi-Arch triplet directory.
      Install library files into /usr/lib/${DEB_TARGET_MULTIARCH}
      directory, instead of /usr/lib/${DEB_TARGET_GNU_TYPE}.
      Should be the right triplet directory this time.
  * debian/watch:
    - Add a missing quotes mark after the equal mark. Now uscan
      command can work as expected.

libbloom (1.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches:
    - backport a patch from upstream to enable BITS setting.
  * debian/rules:
    - Set BITS=default when building/testing according to upstream's
      advice:
        https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom/issues/6
      Apparently the BITS setting (-m32/-m64) is merely for solaris,
      so we simply ignore this in debian.
