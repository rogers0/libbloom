libbloom (1.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches:
    - backport a patch from upstream to enable BITS setting.
  * debian/rules:
    - Set BITS=default when building/testing according to upstream's
      advice:
        https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom/issues/6
      Apparently the BITS setting (-m32/-m64) is merely for solaris,
      so we simply ignore this in debian.
